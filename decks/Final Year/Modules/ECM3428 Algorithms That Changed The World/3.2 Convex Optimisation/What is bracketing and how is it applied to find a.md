<b>Bracketing:</b><br>g(x) = df(x)/dx<br>A root of g(x) is said to be bracketed by a and b if<br>g(a) &lt; 0 and g(b) &gt; 0,<br>or&nbsp;<br>g(a) &gt; 0 and g(b) &lt; 0<br>There must be <b>zero-crossing</b> between a and b<br><br><b>Bisection, repeat until converged:</b><br>bracket root with a and b<br>x = (a+b)/2<br>make a or b equal to x
