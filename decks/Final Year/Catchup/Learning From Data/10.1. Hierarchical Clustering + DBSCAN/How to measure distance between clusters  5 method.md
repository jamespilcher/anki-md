Simple linkage - use two closest members (may make long clusters of short links)<br><br>Complete linkage - use the largest distance between members (tends to break large clusters into 2 or more)<br><br>Average linkage: take the average distance (a lot of comparisons!)<br><br>Centroid linkage: use the centroid distance between the clusters (biased toward spherical clusters)<br><br>Ward's method: join clusters only if it reduces the total distance from the centroids<br><img src="../../../../../media/paste-aadcb7a4d15955df0a9c4f7dde43f7557d820b77.jpg">
