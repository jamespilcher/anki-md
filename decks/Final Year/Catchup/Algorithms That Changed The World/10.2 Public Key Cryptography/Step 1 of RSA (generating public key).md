<summary><b>Reveal answer</b></summary>
- Let n be the product of two large primes p and q, n = pq<br>(large is at least 512 bits)<br>- Select a special number e greater than 1 and less than (p-1)(q-1).&nbsp; Greatest common divisor between e and (p-1)(q-1) must be 1.<br>- Publish the pair of numbers (n, e) as the public key
