<div><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
Many-objective optimisation deals with problems involving <strong>four or more objectives</strong>, making it harder than traditional multi-objective optimisation.</div>
<div><strong>Why it's challenging:</strong></div>
<ol>
<li>
<div><strong>Hard to visualise</strong> high-dimensional Pareto fronts.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Too many non-dominated solutions</strong> weakens selection pressure.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>More solutions needed</strong> to represent the front = high computational cost. (exponential)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Maintaining diversity</strong> becomes difficult in high-dimensional spaces.</div>
